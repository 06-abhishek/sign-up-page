# Full-Stack Sign-In & Sign-Up Form ðŸš€

ðŸ”’ **Full-Stack Sign-In & Sign-Up Form** built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **bcrypt** for secure authentication and user management.

This project demonstrates how to build a **full-stack authentication system** with sign-up, sign-in, and password reset features. Users can securely register, log in, and reset their passwords through a token-based authentication system. The password is encrypted using **bcrypt** for enhanced security.

## Features

### **1. Sign-Up Page**
- Users can register with a **username**, **email**, and **password**.
- Email validation ensures a valid email format.
- Password validation includes rules such as:
  - At least 8 characters, up to 13 characters.
  - Must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one symbol.
- Passwords are securely encrypted using **bcrypt** before storing them in the **MongoDB** database.

### **2. Sign-In Page**
- Allows users to log in using their **email** and **password**.
- The system checks the encrypted password against the stored value in the database.
- Provides an error message if credentials are incorrect.

### **3. Forgot Password / Password Reset**
- Users can request a **password reset** if they forget their password.
- A **reset token** is sent to the userâ€™s email via **Nodemailer**.
- The token expires after 1 hour for security purposes.
- Users can reset their password by entering the new password along with confirmation.

### **4. Dynamic Feedback**
- Success and error messages displayed for account creation, sign-in, password reset, and invalid credentials.
